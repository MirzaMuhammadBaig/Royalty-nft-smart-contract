```
Create a smart contract using the ERC721 and ERC720 standards, allowing for the 
minting of unique Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on any address. There will be a 
predetermined limited supply of these NFTs. For our sake, we assume that the supply is 
50. The starting fee for minting an NFT is 10 USDT. Anyone wanting to mint the NFT 
should deposit minting fees into the smart contract to get the NFT. The fees increases 
by 10 USDT after each mint. When the second NFT is minted , the address owning the 
first NFT will receive a 10% cut of the fee and the smart contract will get 90%. Similarly, 
when the third NFT is minted, the previous two addresses receive 5% each and the 
contract gets 90%. After minting 25 NFTS, the NFT owners cut is increased to 20%.
